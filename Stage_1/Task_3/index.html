				<dd>Ice Bear is a polar bear and the youngest brother. Ice Bear is often stoic and rarely speaks. When he does, he speaks mostly in the third person and mostly says his name first before anything else. He learned to talk much later than his two brothers, as revealed in "The Island". He is multilingual, having been shown to speak Korean, French, and Russian fluently. Ice Bear also is able to speak to pigeons in the episode "Our Stuff." He is also a skilled chef, salsa dancer, a novice at robotics, and a martial artist. Ice is the most composed of the brothers, always maintaining an "ice-cool attitude" in even the most awkward and embarrassing of situations. </dd>
